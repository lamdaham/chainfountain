# Fall Balls
Ryan Li and Ivan Lam

## What is this

This is a simulation to show the collision between boucing balls. We have two modes, inelastic and elastic collisions. We also allowed the user to manipulate gravity using our very user friendly buttons on the side. 

To create this simulation, we use our knowledge of collisions to figure out how the mass and velocity affect the momentum when colliding. As a result, we also have a feature allowing users to change these individual values in individual balls by right clicking on a ball and use the right sidebars to manipulate these values.

We like to give users a bit more control of the simulation, so we gave the users the ability to move a ball in the simulation. Users can use the left and right arrow keys to move the black ball left and right.

## Instructions
Press run program to run the program. \
Click a ball and use the buttons on the right to edit the properties of that ball. These properties will only show up when a ball is selected.\
Left and right arrow keys controls the black ball.  \
Universal properties apply to all balls, and are located above the ball properties.  
If you want to rerun the program, you have to rerun the processing file.
